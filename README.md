Share your frames with others. For now it just reads Afterburner's FPS! Free to use I just want more people to share this instead of just their specs. I might make this standalone later I am not the best with hooks at the moment but it's definitely possible.

IMPORTANT: MSI AFTERBURNER+RIVA (You can install RIVA/RTSS during the MSI Afterburner installation) HAS TO BE INSTALLED!
